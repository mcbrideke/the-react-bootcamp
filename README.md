# the-react-bootcamp

This is an advanvced React bootcamp put together by Bob Ziroll and follows up free introduction bootcamp to react.

link to bootcamp: https://scrimba.com/course/greact

I will complete the course on the scrimba platform which allows me to keep notes and edit code along with the video, but this repo will 
store examples I find particularly important or lengthy.
